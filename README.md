# Bash Snippets
A collection of Bash snippets for use, evaluation, and updates.  Many of these are authored by me, but some are simply good scripts that I've found useful over time.  If you are curious about the authors, please take a look inside the script.
## Purpose
There are three main purposes behind these code snippets, and 
* To document scripts performing very specific functions
  * Saving time on repeated code
  * Providing consistency across code
  * Reminders of how to accomplish certain things
* To serve as examples of how to do some moderately more complex scripts
  * Argument parsing
  * Menu driven system
  * Parsing read files
  * etc.
* To help others see learn
  * Intended to be documented well
  * Brief, specific examples
